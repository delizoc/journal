# journal

Implement a program that models a journal, enabling users to create journal entries, which have a title, body, date and rating. You could use this to log good and bad days, favorite coffee shops, beverages, anime episodes, pair-programming dates - you get the idea.

## Overview
The program should enable a user to view existing journal entries in a list, view a single journal entry, and add a new journal entry. In addition, the program should enable a user to change the application theme from light to dark. The theme preferences and journal data should persist between application restarts. Lastly, the application should be adaptive, based on the amount of horizontal space available on the screen. 

## Requirements
